What are some ADTs that would help dry out the Tic Tac Toe code?
--each individual cells                                               DONE!
--each pattern of winning cells (rows, columns, diagonals)
	--checking for a win function
--updating the cell styling/content/sound etc.

Create a Constructor object in your JS code for each ADT you identified
--Do one at a time
